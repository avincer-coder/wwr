    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to help somehow grow a small business of river rafting. We need this web site to get more people to know about this extraordinary sport. We want to make more online groups and place each group on a rafting boat before entering the river. To achieve that we’ve create this web site. This is going to benefit a lot the business because with more online groups we can improve our incomes even before people arrive to the river within the comfort of their home or hotel people can pre order a rafting boat and set a time to use it! No need to make long queues!  </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The kind of people that are probably going to visit our web site are those who want to have fun and those who like sports as a hobby! Mostly families or parents who want their young and small kids to have fun and participate with them, groups of friends, and couples. This is the type of people we want to keep in mind as we build the website, they want to know cost, time, and how does the river rafting take place. The colors and founts must help people easily see the costs, attract them to the parts where they can know how does our sport environment work, and how to apply for it!  </p>
    <p>
      Pretty much people of any age might want to visit our webpage except small kids where it’s more likely that their parents do the research people between 12 and 40-year-olds might visit our site. 
    </p>

      When searching for a place to practice this sport you may look for flexible hours, good and effective equipment that really helps people on the go, medical attention in case of an emergency, and well, everyone likes low costs they are... attractive! Those are the needs we need to cover.
